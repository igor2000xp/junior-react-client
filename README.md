# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

#### Done: 2022-09-22
I completed this assignment using React classes, TypeScript, Apollo/GraphQL client, graphql-code-generator/typescript. I overrode some classes of Cart Mini-Cart and PDPage because they include very similar components like attributes, price block and etc by extending.
I used a HOC function pattern and a Render Props pattern. Now I have the properly working application.
I used endpoint: https://github.com/Fil1989/awesome-back-live

#### Refactoring
The assignment was not as easy as I supposed. And the code got challenging. I am going to refactor this code. I guess my code will become simpler if I use Context to pass props down component chains.
I am going to change the Apollo server code to add mutations and store the Cart statement on the server instead of using localStorage. And I'm going to try using Props and Composition or decorators to inject business logic into components.

### Now the app is working properly as far as I can see.
I will be happy to receive feedback and get the position of Junior Trainee React Developer (to become a full-stack developer).

### In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
